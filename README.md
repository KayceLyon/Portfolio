Technologies Used:

JavaScript for navigation menu control and carousel controls. jQuery for modal control. Used icons from https://css.gg in my style.css. The modal and the carousel were based on the exercises. I would like to go back and see if I can make something more complex in the future. I ran out of time.

Approach:

Since design and CSS are my weakest areas, I spent a lot of my time on those two elements of the project. 

Difficulties:

Navigation Bar:

It took me several days to get the navigation bar to function and look the way I had it designed in my wireframe. Although I had a vague idea of what to do and partial code from a previous project I had worked on, I had to spend hours searching through MDN and W3Schools to find aria-controls, aria-expanded, element + element and attribute selectors in order to piece something together. Every time I tried to refactor it into jQuery, it would break. I believe this has to do with how .click() or .on() operates as opposed to addEventListener() and I believe that my methods for selecting elements were flawed. I would like to do more research and see if I could refactor it in the future.

CSS:

I spent a good portion of my time working on the styling of the project for it to look as simplistic as it does. While I did learn quite a bit about how to use flexbox and various selectors, I feel as though I need more practice since it still took me several days to make something that looked half-way decent.

Committing:

I need to get out of the habit of worrying about my unfinished code being looked at by others. It is what held me back from making commits throughout the week, and likely cost me passing the project at this point.

Reaching out to IA and Instructors:

There were several points where I was running up against severe problems that could have been solved much sooner had I just reached out to an instructor. I will not make the same mistake again.
